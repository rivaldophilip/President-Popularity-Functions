Project made under supervision of Professor Manfred Keil with a team at Claremont McKenna College in 2019. I analyzed the US and Chiina relation using simple panel regression with Stata.

Steps:
1. Test unit root with Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
2. Create simple unrestricted model
3. Specify the restricted model
4. Calculate Neweyâ€“West standard errors
